# CodeAlpha_Intrusion Detection System

Creating a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) using tools like Snort or Suricata involves several steps, including installation, configuration, rule creation, and alerting.

1.Install Snort                           
You can install either Snort or Suricata on a Linux-based system. Both tools are available in most Linux distributions' package repositories, or you can download and compile them from their official websites.

2.Configure Network Interfaces                                 
Set up the network interface(s) that Snort or Suricata will monitor for suspicious activity. This typically involves configuring promiscuous mode to capture all network traffic on the interface.

3.Configure Rules                               
Define rules to detect specific types of network traffic indicative of malicious activity. Rules can be based on signatures, patterns, or anomalies.

4.Monitoring and Response                                      
Continuously monitor the alerts generated by the NIDS. Establish response procedures for different types of detected attacks. This may include isolating compromised systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, or initiating forensic analysis.
