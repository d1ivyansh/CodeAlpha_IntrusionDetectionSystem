# CodeAlpha_Intrusion Detection System



Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection system (NIDS) and network intrusion prevention system (NIPS) created by Sourcefire, now owned by Cisco. It is widely used for real-time traffic analysis and packet logging on IP networks.

Creating a network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) using tools like Snort or Suricata involves several steps, including installation, configuration, rule creation, and alerting.

1.Installation:                               
Install Snort on a Linux system using package managers like apt or yum, or compile it from source.
Configuration:

The main configuration file for Snort is typically located at /etc/snort/snort.conf.
Use the snort -T -c /path/to/snort.conf command to test the configuration file for syntax errors without actually starting Snort.
Starting and Stopping Snort:

Use the following commands to start and stop Snort:
bash
Copy code
sudo snort -q -u snort -g snort -i <interface> -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -D
sudo kill -SIGTERM $(pidof snort)

2.Packet Capture:                                  
Snort can analyze packets from live network interfaces or from packet capture (PCAP) files.
Use the -r option to specify a PCAP file for offline analysis.

3.Rule Management:                                                    
Snort rules define conditions for detecting suspicious network traffic. Rules are stored in text files, typically located in /etc/snort/rules.
Use the snort -T -c /path/to/snort.conf -R command to test a rule file for syntax errors.

4.Alerting:                                                     
Snort generates alerts when it detects network traffic matching defined rules.
Alerts are logged to the console, to text files, or can be sent to a remote syslog server.
Use the -A option to specify the alerting method (e.g., -A fast, -A full).

5.Logging:                                                        
Snort can log alert data, packet data, or both.
Use the -l option to specify the directory where log files will be stored.

6.Rule Management:                                     
Snort rules define conditions for detecting suspicious network traffic. Rules are stored in text files, typically located in /etc/snort/rules.
Use the snort -T -c /path/to/snort.conf -R command to test a rule file for syntax errors.
